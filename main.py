#Wap to print the average marks of each student.

# Functions:

# Program 5: Can you rewrite the code to calculate average as an function and use it?
# Program 6: Create a mini dataset progamatically taking inputs in python.

	# students = []

# Program 7: Can we store the input that we are taking into a CSV File?
# Program 8: Now, can we load the data from the csv file?
# Program 9: Can we import a math library to do mathematical aggregations?
# Program 10: Lets run this from jupyternotebook/google collab.
