Text Mining in python
- Extracting meaningful information from Text.
- Application:
  > Sentimental Analysis
  > Spam detection
  > Chatbots
  > Search Engines

> NLP
Nlp is the science of making machines understand human language.

- Library: NLPK 

> Text Processing: Text must be cleaned before Analysis.
- Lower Casing: standardizes the Text
- removing punctuation: it is actually a noise.
- Tokenization: splitting sentence into words
- remove stop words: common words like the, is, that don't add meaning
- steamming: cutting words to their base. eg: running --> run
- lemamatization: more intelligent version of steamming (eg. better--> good)
