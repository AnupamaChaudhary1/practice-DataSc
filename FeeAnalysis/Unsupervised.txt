Unsupervised learning is like giving the computer a bunch of data without any answers and asking it:
- Can you dind something interesting here?
Real World Analogy:
- Its like giving a kid a box of Legos without instructions and seeing how they group them by size, shape, or color on their own.
- Imagine giving a box full of mixed socks to someone and asking them to group them however they want- maybe by color, size, or pattern. We
are saying anything on how to do it. This is unsuperised algorithm.

Examples: 
- recommendation systems
- Anomaly  detection

How does computer find patterns?
- The computer finds patterns by measuring similarities or differences between data points.
- It looks for things that seem to belong together.

> It measures distances: Are these two data points (students, products, images) close or far from each other?
> It groups based on closeness: Items that are similar stay together.
> It repeats this until patterbs emerge - Like finding students with similar marks or customers with similar buying habits.

2. What does it mean to group things?
- Grouping means putting similar things together. In ML, these groups are called clusters.
In the context of sutdets:
- Group A: High performers in all subjects.
- Group B: good at theory, weak in practice.
- Group C: poor attendance, low score.

The algorithm doesn't know these labels  - it just notices these patterns form the data and group them accordingly.
The machine is creating categories based only on similarities, without us tellling it what to look for.

3. Shrinking. Ehat soes it signigy?
This is relates to PCA (Principle Component Analysis) a technique used to simplify complex data. 

Imagine you have a table with 100 columns. PCA helps uks: 
- Shrink (reduce) those 100 colomns into 2 or 3 meaningful ones 
- It keeps the ost imp info.
- It removes noise and repititive patterns,
 Think of PCA like compressing a big suitvcase inot a small backpack without loosing the essential.


In real life:
- We may have 10 features for a student.
- PCA will shrink this to may be 2 combined features "academic strength" and "attendance".


#### K-Means algorithm: Unsupervised algorithm
- Imagine you are sorting 100 different colored marbels. We want 3 groups based on color.
- We randomly start with 3 color guesses.
- We assign each marble to the nearest color group.
- We adjust the color centers based on the actual group members. 
- repeat until everything stabilizes.

# Step by step algorithm
- choose the number of clusters(k).
- randomly place k points (called centroid).
- assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
- recalculate centroids based on assigned points.
- repeat Steps 3-4 until centroids does not change.

# Euclidean distance formula:
 Straight line distance between two points in space.
  for two points:
  Point A=(x1,x2)
  Point B=(y1,y2)
  distance=sqrt [(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2]
