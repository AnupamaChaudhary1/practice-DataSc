Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and 
presentation of data. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem,
 it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied.

Simple random sample:
Definition: Every member of a population has an equal chance of being selected to be in the sample. 
Randomly select members through the use of a random number generator or some means of random selection. 

Stratified random sample
Definition: Split a population into groups. Randomly select some members from each group to be in the sample.

Cluster random sample
Definition: Split a population into clusters.
 Randomly select some of the clusters and include all members from those clusters in the sample.

Systematic random sample

Non-probability Sampling Methods
Another class of sampling methods is known as non-probability sampling methods because not every member
 in a population has an equal probability of being selected to be in the sample.

3. undrstanding variables and measurements
variables- quantative, 



analyzing data distributions and central tendencies
how values are spread in datasets
mean= to determine outlier
median= middle values
mode= frequently repeated values

measure of disperssion
range=max val-min val
